- `git reset â€”hard HEAD~` - remove last commit completely
- `git reset (--soft) HEAD~` - undo last commit, but keep changes
- `git commit --amend` - update last commit. To include additional changes to last commit we need `git add .` Use `--no-edit` flag when we don't want to edit commit message.
- `git revert <commit hash>` - create a new commit that reverts the specific commit or range of commits.
